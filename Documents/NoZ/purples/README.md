npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Dependencies

This project is built using [nextjs v13](https://nextjs.org) and [tailwindcss v3.3.3](tailwindcss.com).

We use [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (using this only in parts of the project) for type checking and [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for linting.

Icons are from [feathericons](https://feathericons.com/).

note: although we use nextjs 13, we are using the `/pages` routing for stability.

## Resuable Components

To make it easier to build pages, we have created a number of reusable components. These are located in the `components` folder.

for more information, see the [components readme](./COMPONENTS.md)
